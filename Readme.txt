Project Description
This is a project from the Odin Project. In this project, Javascript object 
basics are practiced. A library is to be created. The books in the library will 
have the following properties: Author, title, number of pages, publisher, publi-
cation date, read status. Whenever the library webpage is loaded, the books in 
the library should be displayed on the page along with their properties. There 
should be a button to add new books. Each book's display should include a but-
ton to remove the book from the library and another button to update the book's 
read status.
In the development of this project, eslint and prettier were used, as well.
